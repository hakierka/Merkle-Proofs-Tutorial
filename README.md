## Introduction
### Merkle Trees: The Foundation
#### What are Merkle Trees?
Before we dive into Merkle Proofs, it's crucial to grasp the concept of Merkle Trees. Named after Ralph Merkle, they are binary tree structures designed for efficient data integrity verification in large datasets.
### Exploring Merkle Proofs: Secure Membership Verification
Merkle Proofs are like the secret sauce of data integrity, letting us prove something's in a big collection without giving away the whole stash. Imagine you want to check if your name's on a guest list, but you don't want to see the entire list â€“ Merkle Proofs make it happen.

In a Merkle Tree:

- Each leaf node represents a piece of data (e.g., a transaction in a blockchain).
- Each non-leaf (internal) node is a cryptographic hash of its child nodes.
  
## How Merkle Proofs Work

### Proving Data Membership Efficiently

Merkle Proofs allow you to prove the existence of a specific item in a dataset without revealing the entire dataset. The process involves:

1. **Creating a Merkle Tree**: Construct a Merkle Tree from your dataset by hashing each data item and building the tree structure.
2. **Generating a Proof**: To prove the existence of a specific item, generate a Merkle Proof for that item. The proof consists of a series of sibling hashes along the path from the item to the root of the tree.
3. **Verification**: Anyone with access to the Merkle Tree and the Merkle Proof can reconstruct the path from the item to the root, verifying its authenticity.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Practical Implementation

### Code Structure

In this repository, you'll find two main files:

- `merkle.js`: Contains the JavaScript/TypeScript code to create a Merkle Tree and generate Merkle Proofs.
- `other-files.js`: Contains helper functions and classes used in `merkle.js`.

### Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/hakierka/Merkle-Proofs-Tutorial.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd Merkle-Proofs-Tutorial
```
3. Install the required dependencies 
```
npm install
```
4. Modify the data array in `merkle.js` to include the data items you want to use.
5. Run the code to create a Merkle Tree and generate Merkle Proofs.
```
npm start
```
The script will calculate the Merkle Proof for the specified email and verify if it's whitelisted.
6. View the output in the console to see if the email is whitelisted or not.

### Conclusion
Merkle Proofs play a vital role in ensuring data integrity and membership verification without revealing the complete dataset. This tutorial provides both an explanation of the theory behind Merkle Trees and a practical implementation in JavaScript. Feel free to explore and experiment with different datasets and use cases to deepen your understanding of this cryptographic technique.

Detailed explanations and comments are provided in the code to help you understand each step of the process.

### Other Files

`other-files.js` is a supplementary JavaScript module designed to enhance the functionality of the Merkle Proofs Tutorial. This module provides essential helper functions, classes, and configurations used in the `merkle.js` file for creating Merkle Trees and generating Merkle Proofs.
#### Helper Functions

- **calculateMerkleHash**: Calculates the hash of two concatenated values, used in Merkle Tree construction.
  
#### Custom Data Structure

- **MerkleProof**: A custom data structure representing a Merkle Proof. It includes methods to add proof nodes and set the root.
  
#### Configuration Options

- **merkleConfig**: Configuration options for Merkle Proof generation. Currently, it specifies the hash algorithm used (default is 'sha256'). Additional options can be added if needed.
  
#### Error Handling

- **handleMerkleError**: A function for handling potential errors related to Merkle Proofs.

`other-files.js` serves as a valuable resource for enhancing the extensibility and clarity of your Merkle Proofs implementation.
