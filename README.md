## Introduction
### Merkle Trees: The Foundation
#### What are Merkle Trees?
Before we dive into Merkle Proofs, it's crucial to grasp the concept of Merkle Trees. Named after Ralph Merkle, they are binary tree structures designed for efficient data integrity verification in large datasets.
### Exploring Merkle Proofs: Secure Membership Verification
Merkle Proofs are like the secret sauce of data integrity, letting us prove something's in a big collection without giving away the whole stash. Imagine you want to check if your name's on a guest list, but you don't want to see the entire list â€“ Merkle Proofs make it happen.

In a Merkle Tree:

- Each leaf node represents a piece of data (e.g., a transaction in a blockchain).
- Each non-leaf (internal) node is a cryptographic hash of its child nodes.
  
## How Merkle Proofs Work

### Proving Data Membership Efficiently

Merkle Proofs allow you to prove the existence of a specific item in a dataset without revealing the entire dataset. The process involves:

1. **Creating a Merkle Tree**: Construct a Merkle Tree from your dataset by hashing each data item and building the tree structure.
2. **Generating a Proof**: To prove the existence of a specific item, generate a Merkle Proof for that item. The proof consists of a series of sibling hashes along the path from the item to the root of the tree.
3. **Verification**: Anyone with access to the Merkle Tree and the Merkle Proof can reconstruct the path from the item to the root, verifying its authenticity.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Practical Implementation

### Code Structure

In this repository, you'll find:
- `merkle.js`: Contains the JavaScript/TypeScript code to create a Merkle Tree and generate Merkle Proofs.

### Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/hakierka/Merkle-Proofs-Tutorial.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd Merkle-Proofs-Tutorial
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```
npm install
```

4. Run the script:
```
npm start
```
5. The program will prompt you to enter an email address to check if it's whitelisted.
Enter the email address you want to verify.

7. Check the Result
The program will then verify if the provided email address is whitelisted using Merkle Proofs. It will display one of the following messages:

- "Email address is whitelisted!" if the email address is in the whitelist.
- "Email address is not whitelisted!" if the email address is not in the whitelist.

7. Customize Whitelisted Emails
In the merkle.js file, you can customize the list of whitelisted email addresses. By default, the code whitelists three email addresses: `amy@example.com`, `jenna@example.com`, and `tanay@example.com`.
```
const whitelistedEmails = [
  'amy@example.com',
  'jenna@example.com',
  'tanay@example.com'
];
```
Feel free to modify this array to include the email addresses you want to whitelist.



### Conclusion
Merkle Proofs play a vital role in ensuring data integrity and membership verification without revealing the complete dataset. This tutorial provides both an explanation of the theory behind Merkle Trees and a practical implementation in JavaScript. Feel free to explore and experiment with different datasets and use cases to deepen your understanding of this cryptographic technique.

Detailed explanations and comments are provided in the code to help you understand each step of the process.
